        <h1>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS</h1>
        <p> The difference between inline, embedded, and external is inline we would use the atribute within the line, embedded is using the tags within the heads, and external is used to place CSS code, and used to seperate files and links to the html document   </p>
        <h1>Explain why you should only use external CSS</h1>
        <p>You should only use external CSS because we can use it to seperate and contains CSS files, that uses a css extension (first.css) or style multiple HTML pages within a single style sheet.   </p>
        <h1>What is a selector used for? </h1>
        <p>The selector is used to find and select the HTML tags that you would want to style. </p>
