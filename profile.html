   <p> I am from Hilo, Hawai'i; Grew up mostly in the town of Keaukaha up until the age of three. Since then life had took a turn with many hardships within my life.
    I have learned to take them as blessings, and eventually I was then adopted by the person that I call my mom now. I am so grateful for the many things that come into my life, since moving to Oʻahu Hawaiʻi. And I guess that you can say I almost lived in many districts. I am now 18 years old, and have recently graduated from Kamehameha Schools Kāpalama, and had recieved my Associates from Hawaiʻi Pacific University (HPU). I am also continuing my education to earn my Bachelorʻs Degree.   </p>
   <p>With one of the many things that I 
    really enjoy is the scenery of nature. Being outside away from technology or just the everyday life; really just brings me satisfaction
    to connect to myself and allows me to view the bigger perspective on my surroundings.</p>
